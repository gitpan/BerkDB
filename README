DESCRIPTION
-----------

BerkDB is a module which allows Perl programs to make use of the
facilities provided by Berkeley DB version 2. (Note: if you want to use
version 1 of Berkeley DB with Perl you need DB_File).

Berkeley DB is a C library which provides a consistent interface to a
number of database formats. BerkDB provides an interface to all three
of the database types (hash, btree and recno) currently supported by
Berkeley DB.

For further details see the documentation included at the end of the
file BerkDB.pm.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

Before you can build BerkDB you need to have the following installed
on your system:

    * Perl 5.004_02 or greater. 

    * Berkeley DB. Version 2.3.11 or greater 

      The official web site for Berkeley DB is
      http://www.sleepycat.com/db. The ftp equivalent is
      ftp.sleepycat.com:/pub. 


BUILDING THE MODULE
-------------------

Assuming you have met all the prerequisites, building the module should
be relatively straightforward.

The first step is to edit the file config.in to suit you local
installation. Instructions are given in the file.

The module can now be built and tested using this sequence of
commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test


INSTALLATION
------------

    make install

FEEDBACK
--------

How to report a problem with BerkDB.

To help me help you, I need of the following information:

 1. The version of Perl and the operating system name and version you
    are running. If you are running a newish version of Perl, the
    output from running "perl -V" will tell me all I need to know. 
    If your perl doesn't understand the -V flag, then not only do you
    have quite an old version of Perl, you very likely have an old
    version of BerkDB.  You should consider upgrading. The problem you
    have might already be fixed.

 2. The version of BerkDB you have. If you have successfully installed
    BerkDB, this one-liner will tell you:

       perl -e 'use BerkDB; print "BerkDB ver $BerkDB::VERSION\n"'

    If you haven't installed BerkDB then search BerkDB.pm for a line
    like this:

      $VERSION = "1.20" ;

 3. The version of Berkeley DB you have installed. 

 4. If you are having problems building BerkDB, send me a complete log
    of what happened.

 5. Now the difficult one. If you think you have found a bug in BerkDB
    and you want me to fix it, you will *greatly* enhance the chances
    of me being able to track it down by sending me a small
    self-contained Perl script that illustrates the problem you are
    encountering. Include a summary of what you think the problem is
    and a log of what happens when you run the script, in case I can't
    reproduce your problem on my system. If possible, don't have the
    script dependent on an existing 20Meg database. If the script you
    send me can create the database itself then that is preferred.

    I realise that in some cases this is easier said than done, so if
    you can only reproduce the problem in your existing script, then
    you can post me that if you want. Just don't expect me to find your
    problem in a hurry, or at all. :-)
